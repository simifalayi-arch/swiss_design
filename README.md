📌 About This Project

This project was created for the Design Lineage Gallery assignment, following the instructions in the course repository:

https://github.com/kaw393939/swiss_design_lineage_vibecoding

The purpose of this assignment is to:

Select a historical design style

Research its origins, evolution, and principles

Build a website that demonstrates the style visually

Curate a gallery of real examples influenced by that design movement

Host the site publicly using GitHub Pages

This project focuses on Swiss Style, also known as the International Typographic Style.

🎨 What is Swiss Style?

Swiss Style emerged in Switzerland during the 1950s, shaped by designers in Zürich and Basel. It is defined by:

Clean, objective sans-serif typography

Strict grid systems

Asymmetric layouts

Minimal use of color (often red, black, white)

A belief that design should be universal and functional, not decorative

Swiss Style has influenced everything from corporate identity systems to modern UI/UX design.
